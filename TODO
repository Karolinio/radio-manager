Todo:
  ☐ create global method to calculate window position
  ☐ make all pop ups (alerts and edit modals) to appear in the middle of current window (does not work for default java alerts)
  ✔ create alerts for edit modal (when input is invalid) @done(20-08-17 22:05)
  ☐ make add and edit functionality use the same modal (not sure if this is recommended even though it would make program file smaller)
  ✔ add possibility to open radio link @done(20-08-21 12:01)
  ☐ redo alerts so they are consist, short and non repetetive 
  ✔ add tools to toolbar (add, edit, delete) @done(20-08-17 22:04)
  ✔ Add/fix consistency between scenes (save, open etc.) @done(20-06-05 00:33)
  ✔ change the way favorite attribute is presented in program (1/0 -> yes/no) @done(20-06-05 00:33)
  ☐ Add undo redo functionality 
  ☐ Add search functionality (probally requires change on how selected items are handled)
  ☐ Create custom css
  ☐ Add explainations to input validaion alerts (now it only tells about what is wrong but does not tell how it should be. It should also tell the user that it is possible to turn it off)
  ✔ Add warning when user wants to turn input validation off (without input validation it is possible to corrupt file.) @done(20-08-27 22:15)
  ☐ Change the true and false to unicode star (this will make it more true to game's radio manager) 
  ☐ Describe observer in App class (it is out of place and may be introduce mess later)
  ☐ Try to find a soultion for strings to not be hardcoded (have strings to be in xml file and refer to them in the program)
  ☐ Remove alert upon successfull save (most program do not inform user about sucessful save)
  ☐ Add option to save & exit instead of exit
  ☐ Add status bar down that inform about current settings (for example the input validation is off)
  ☐ Remove sematrics for when url is not possible to open (it lead to confusion as link aperar to be clicable but nothing happens as it disabled)
  ☐ Consider using windows native alerts instead of javafx ones 
  ☐ Add possibility to add radios from webpages (tunein.com)

Bugs: 
  ☐ Address the problem with non engilsh letters displays as codes
    Some ideas on how to solve this problem: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8004995/how-can-i-convert-these-utf-8-literals-into-character-strings
  ✔ While adding radio, input validation alert tells about invalid favorite format instead of bitrate @done(20-08-19 19:48)
  ✔ When non english character is inputed, it is not recognised and saved as unknown character that makes file unreadable afterwards @done(20-08-18 20:54)
    For now this is done by converting string to bytes using utf-8 and then coverting back to string while data are formatted upon save
    Converting using byte streams should be better solution here https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/i18n/text/stream.html
  ✔ Input validation allows url and genre field to be empty @done(20-08-20 22:22)
  ✔ Empty error shows up if windows save modal is closed upon save as @done(20-08-19 20:07)
  ✔ After an entry has been edited, the button for edit is til avaiable while no station is choosen @done(20-08-21 12:55)
  ☐ after entry has been changed, the information below does not update (maybe it is just a feature)
  ✔ it is possible to open blank link (the "http://") which does nothing bad but it is unrelated to program's functionality and may lead to confiusion @done(20-08-24 18:53)
  ☐ If not done already, up lenth of allowed name string (current 30) which is short for some names

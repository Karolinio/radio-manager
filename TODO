Todo:
  ☐ create global method to calculate window position
  ☐ make all pop ups (alerts and edit modals) to appear in the middle of current window (does not work for default java alerts)
  ✔ create alerts for edit modal (when input is invalid) @done(20-08-17 22:05)
  ☐ make add and edit functionality use the same modal (not sure if this is recommended even though it would make program file smaller)
  ☐ add possibility to open radio link
  ☐ redo alerts so they are consist, short and non repetetive 
  ✔ add tools to toolbar (add, edit, delete) @done(20-08-17 22:04)

Todo-later:
  ✔ Add/fix consistency between scenes (save, open etc.) @done(20-06-05 00:33)
  ✔ change the way favorite attribute is presented in program (1/0 -> yes/no) @done(20-06-05 00:33)
  ☐ Add undo redo functionality 
  ☐ Add search functionality (probally requires change on how selected items are handled)
  ☐ Create custom css 


Bugs: 
  ☐ Address the problem with non engilsh letters displays as codes
    Some ideas on how to solve this problem: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8004995/how-can-i-convert-these-utf-8-literals-into-character-strings
  ☐ While adding radio, input validation alert tells about invalid favorite format instead of bitrate
  ✔ When non english character is inputed, it is not recognised and saved as unknown character that makes file unreadable afterwards @done(20-08-18 20:54)
    For now this is done by converting string to bytes using utf-8 and then coverting back to string while data are formatted upon save
    Converting using byte streams should be better solution here https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/i18n/text/stream.html
  ☐ Input validation allows url and genre field to be empty
